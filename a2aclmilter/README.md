# ARPA2 ACL milter

The a2aclmilter daemon tests whether a sender may communicate with a receiver
given an [ARPA2] ACL policy.

Status: **beta**

## Requirements

Build requirements:
* A C89 compiler
* CMake >= 3.3
* liba2acl
* libmilter >= 8.16

Run-time requirements:
* Any POSIX-compliant system


## Usage example

In order to let a mailserver like Postfix query the milter for every incoming
mail about whether or not communication is allowed, start the milter with the
desired policy file, and configure Postfix to use the milter. In this example
the policy file `/etc/a2aclpolicy` is used. The milter is instructed to drop
privileges to the unprivileged user id 2498 and chroot to /etc/opt. Let it
listen on localhost port 7000 for incoming connections:

```sh
a2aclmilter /etc/a2aclpolicy 2498 /etc/opt inet:7000@127.0.0.1
```

In order to let Postfix communicate with the milter add the following line to
`/etc/postfix/main.cf`:

```
smtpd_milters = inet:127.0.0.1:7000
```

For a more complete and interactive example see the [Docker demo].
