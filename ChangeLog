2019-07-15, Version 0.6.0

Breaking changes to the API in order to preserve freedom to refactor and hide
internal implementation details from the user. This lowers the cognitive load
required and time needed to understand this library. In previous versions the
ostensibly clear a2id structure could be perceived as seriously broken once a
user had used a2id_generalize(3). In fact the structure has never been broken,
but details about whether or not strings we're either nul terminated or NULL,
and whether the localpart got efficiently broken up by generalization splitting
the localpart and domain of the id, never got communicated to the user because
this structure was intended for internal use only. This fact is now solidified
in code by removing visibility of the structure and resorting to internal
linkage, further simplifying the public API. The only thing the user needs is a
new opaque a2id type. If an id needs to be converted back to a string the new
and more powerful a2id_tostr(3) function can be used.

Future additions to the API might include export possibilities of more fields,
but this will be driven by practical demand of popular use-cases and usage
patterns.

Look at arpa2/a2id.h and the associated manpages in a2id(3) for the new and
revamped API.
